## Welcome to Data Handling: I.C.V. 2021!

- Fire up your notebooks!
- Go to this page: http://bit.ly/datahandling-2021
- Use one row to respond to the questions in the column headers (see the first two rows for examples).


# Introductory Example

## Data input, processing, output

```{r blackbox, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/cpu_blackbox.png")
```

## The Data Pipeline

```{r datascience, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE, fig.cap="Data Science workflow. Source: @wickham_grolemund2017, licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/) license."}
include_graphics("../img/data-science.png")
```

## The Data Pipeline

```{r datascience2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE, fig.cap="Data Science workflow. Source: @wickham_grolemund2017, licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/) license."}
include_graphics("../img/data-science.png")
```

What could be the *output* of all this?


## The Data Pipeline

- Research report/paper (e.g., BA Thesis)
- Presentation/Slides
- Website
- Web application (interactive; alas the introductory example)
- Dashboard for management
- Recommender system (i.e., a trained machine learning algorithm)
- ...

## 'Data Science'?



## 'Data Science'?

*"This coupling of scientific discovery and practice involves the collection, management, processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of vast amounts of heterogeneous data associated with a diverse array of scientific, translational, and inter-disciplinary applications."*

University of Michigan 'Data Science Initiative', 2015


## But, what about statistics?!

*"Seemingly, statistics is being marginalized here; the implicit message is that statistics is a part of what goes on in data science but not a very big part. At the same time, many of the concrete descriptions of what the DSI will actually do will seem to statisticians to be bread-and-butter statistics. Statistics is apparently the word that dare not speak its name in connection with such an initiative!"*

David Donoho (2015). __50 years of Data Science__

## What's new about all this?

*"All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."*
